# Furniture Emporium

A **card** is a common design pattern in web development. It consists of a single container that groups together content, such as thumbnails, supporting text, and buttons, that is all related to a single topic. A use-case that you might already be familiar with is the _product card_, which displays information about a product for an online store.

In this workshop, you will be working on the product cards for a fictional furniture store named Furniture Emporium.
